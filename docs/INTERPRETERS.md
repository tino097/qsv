## Luau

[Luau](https://luau-lang.org) is a fast, small, safe, gradually typed, statically linked, embeddable scripting language derived from [Lua](https://www.lua.org/about.html). It lies at the [heart of Roblox technology](https://luau-lang.org/2022/11/04/luau-origins-and-evolution.html) - powering all it's user generated content, with [Roblox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Roblox)'s own internal code having more than 2 millions lines of Luau. 

It has [sandboxing](https://luau-lang.org/sandbox), [type-checking](https://luau-lang.org/typecheck), [additional operators](https://luau-lang.org/syntax) & [increased performance](https://luau-lang.org/performance) while [maintaining compatibility with Lua](https://luau-lang.org/compatibility).

[Lua is faster than Python](https://benchmarksgame-team.pages.debian.net/benchmarksgame/fastest/lua-python3.html) & Luau is even faster still - more so, as qsv precompiles Luau into bytecode. In addition, [`luau`](/src/cmd/luau.rs#L2) is embedded into qsv, has debug logging, can do aggregations with its `--begin` & `--end` options & has no external dependencies unlike the `py` command.

It also allows mapping of multiple new computed columns, supports random access with indexed CSV files, and has [several helper functions](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/blob/c0c2d5ab3e4ea9cc0e861c6ad41652677ffc4f20/src/cmd/luau.rs#L1250-L1931) to help ease the development of [full-fledged data-wrangling scripts](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/blob/4e521b177ea3a6a06c83222458bb1349a67606f4/tests/test_luau.rs#L524-L571).

As date manipulation is often needed, the [LuaDate](https://tieske.github.io/date/) module is also bundled.

Finally, as [qsv's DSL](../README.md#luau_deeplink) (ðŸ‘‘), `luau` will gain even more features over time compared to the `python` feature.

[Luau 0.653](https://github.com/Roblox/luau/releases/tag/0.663) is currently embedded - qsv's policy is to use the latest stable Luau version at the time of each qsv release.

## Building qsv with python feature

If you wish to build qsv with the `python` feature, make sure you have the development libraries for the desired Python version (Python 3.8 and above are supported) installed when doing so (e.g. on Debian/Ubuntu - `apt-get install python-dev`; on CentOS/RedHat/Amazon Linux - `yum install python-devel`; on Windows and macOS - use the [Python installer](https://www.python.org/downloads/) for the desired version).

If you plan to distribute your manually built `qsv` with the `python` feature, `qsv` will look for the specific version of Python shared libraries (libpython* on Linux/macOS, python*.dll on Windows) against which it was compiled starting with the current directory & abort with an error if not found, detailing the Python library it was looking for. 

Note that this will happen on qsv startup, even if you're NOT running the `py` command.

When building from source - [PyO3](https://pyo3.rs) - the underlying crate that enables the `python` feature, uses a build script to determine the Python version & set the correct linker arguments. By default it uses the python3 executable.
You can override this by setting `PYO3_PYTHON` (e.g., `PYO3_PYTHON=python3.7`), before installing/compiling qsv. See the [PyO3 User Guide](https://pyo3.rs/v0.23.3/building-and-distribution.html) for more information.

Consider using the [`luau`](/src/cmd/luau.rs#L2) command instead of the [`py`]((/src/cmd/python.rs#L2)) command if the operation you're trying to do can be done with `luau` - as `luau` is statically linked, has no external dependencies, much faster than `py`, can do aggregations, supports random access, has a bevy of qsv helper functions, and allows mapping of multiple new columns. 

The `py` command cannot do aggregations because Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) limitations will quickly consume a lot of memory (see [issue 449](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/issues/449#issuecomment-1226095316) for details).
To prevent this, the `py` command processes CSVs in batches (default: 50,000 records), with a GIL pool for each batch, so no globals are available across batches.
