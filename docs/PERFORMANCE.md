# Performance Tuning
([TLDR Guide](PERFORMANCE_TLDR.md))

## Index! Index! Index!

Indexing your CSV files is key for performance. Here's why:

1. **Faster Slicing**: `slice` uses the index to directly retrieve relevant rows.

2. **Instant Row Counts**: `count` the total number of rows instantly. It also sets up
the `--progressbar` faster, and speeds qsv when it needs the row count (which it does for just about every command).

3. **Parallel Processing**: Indexing enables multithreading, dramatically speeding up supported commands like `stats`, `frequency`, `sample`, `split` and `tojsonl`.

4. **Random Access**: The `luau` command gains random access capabilities. `extsort` CSV mode requires an index.

5. **Low Overhead**: Creating an index is fast and efficient, even for very large files. The million row, 41-column, 520mb NYC 311 benchmark file for instance, takes all of 466 ms to index.

Even if you're only handling a CSV file once, and its not reference data, indexing still makes sense if you're `slicing`, `counting`, `sampling`, using the `--progressbar` or compiling summary statistics with the `stats` and `frequency` commands.

The only time indexing is not useful is when the CSV file is too small to benefit from indexing or when the file is not seekable (e.g. stdin).

To enable automatic indexing:
- Set the `QSV_AUTOINDEX_SIZE` environment variable
- Specify the minimum file size (in bytes) for auto-indexing

```bash
# automatically create an index for files larger than 10MB
export QSV_AUTOINDEX_SIZE=10000000
```

## Stats Cache
`stats` is the primary reason qsv was created. In 2021, several projects we were working on required GUARANTEED data type inferences at speed. As we iterated and started additional projects, we started needing additional capabilities to enable the ["automagical metadata"](https://dathere.com/2023/11/automagical-metadata/) inferencing workflow we wanted for our data ingestion pipelines.

From the original 11 summary statistics in xsv (type, sum, min/max, min/max length, mean, stddev, median, mode & cardinality ), 35 more were added incrementally over time (is_ascii, range, sort_order/sortiness, min/max/sum/avg/stddev/variance/cv lengths, sem, geometric_mean, harmonic_mean, variance, cv, nullcount, max_precision, sparsity, mad, lower outer/inner fence, q1, q2_median, q3, iqr, upper inner/outer fence, skewness, uniqueness_ratio, mode_count, mode_occurrences, antimode, antimode_count, antimode_occurrences) [more info](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/wiki/Supplemental#stats-command-output-explanation).

And some of these stats were relatively expensive to compute, we added stats caching so it didn't need to recompute them if a file hasn't changed (as most of the files we were working on were historical data).

Over time, we realized that the cached stats can be used to make other commands faster and smarter - thus the stats cache was born!

- `frequency` uses the stats cache to short-circuit compiling frequency tables for ID columns (all unique values) by looking at the cardinality of a column and fetching rowcounts from the cache.
- `schema` uses the cache to create a JSON Schema Validation file. It uses the cache to set the data type, enum values, const values, minLength, maxLength, minimum and maximum properties in the JSON Schema file.
- `tojsonl` uses the cache to set the JSON data type, and to infer boolean JSON properties.
- `sqlp` and `joinp` uses the cache to create a Polars Schema, short-circuting Polars' schema inferencing - which is not as reliable as it depends on sampling the first N rows of a CSV, which may lead to wrong type inferences if the sample size is not large enough (which if set too large, slows down the Polars engine). As the data type inferences of `stats` are guaranteed, its not only faster, it works all the time!
- `pivotp` uses the cache extensively to automatically infer the best aggregation function to use based on the attributes of the pivot and value columns.
- `diff` uses the cache to short-circuit comparison if the files fingerprint hashes are identical. It also uses the rowcount and cardinality of the primary key column to check for uniqueness.
- `sample` uses the cache to skip unnecessary scanning and to inform its sampling strategies.

For the most part, the default caching behavior works transparently, though you will notice several files with the same file stem will start appearing in the same location as your CSV files. As metadata is tiny by nature and very useful on its own, a conscious decision was made not to hide them.

If you want to fine-tune qsv's caching behavior, use the `--cache-threshold` option. It's one of the few options that based on its value, can be different units:
- when greater than 1, the threshold in MILLISECONDS before caching stats results
- when set to 0 - suppresses caching
- when set to 1 - forces caching

  As `stats` is much faster with an index. It also controls auto-indexing:
- when set to a negative number, automatically creates an index when the input file size is greater than the absolute of the provided values in BYTES. The stats cache remains after `stats` finishes.
- when set to a negative number AND the number ends with 5, it will automatically create an index, compile the stats, AND then delete the index as well as the stats cache files afterwards.

> NOTE: To ensure the stats cache is used by "smart" commands, run `stats` with the `--stats-jsonl` option. This will create the stats cache file in the same directory as the input file.

## CPU Optimization

Modern CPUs have various features that the Rust compiler can take advantage
of to increase performance. If you want the compiler to take advantage of these
CPU-specific speed-ups, set this environment variable **BEFORE** installing/compiling qsv:

On Linux and macOS:

```bash
export CARGO_BUILD_RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native'
```

On Windows Powershell:

```powershell
$env:CARGO_BUILD_RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native'
```

Do note though that the resulting binary will only run on machines with the
same architecture as the machine you installed/compiled from.
To find out your CPU architecture and other valid values for `target-cpu`:

```bash
rustc --print target-cpus

# to find out what CPU features are used by the Rust compiler WITHOUT specifying target-cpu
rustc --print cfg | grep -i target_feature

# to find out what additional CPU features will be used by the Rust compiler when you specify target-cpu=native
rustc --print cfg -C target-cpu=native | grep -i target_feature

# to get a short explanation of each CPU target-feature
rustc --print target-features
```

## Memory Management
### Memory Allocator

qsv supports three memory allocators: mimalloc, jemalloc and the standard allocator.

By default, qsv uses [mimalloc](https://github.com/microsoft/mimalloc), a performance-oriented allocator from Microsoft.

You can also use another alternative - the [jemalloc](https://jemalloc.net) allocator, which is the default Linux allocator used by the [Pola.rs](https://www.pola.rs) project for its python bindings, as benchmarks have shown that it [performs better than mimalloc on some platforms](https://docs.rs/polars/latest/polars/#custom-allocator).

If you don't want to use mimalloc, use the `--no-default-features` flag when installing/compiling qsv, e.g.:

#### To use jemalloc

```bash
cargo install qsv --path . --no-default-features --features all_features,jemallocator
```

or

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features all_features,jemallocator
```

#### To use the standard allocator

```bash
cargo install qsv --path . --no-default-features --features all_features
```

or

```bash
cargo build --release --no-default-features --features all_features
```

To find out what memory allocator qsv is using, run `qsv --version`. After the qsv version number, the allocator used is displayed ("`standard`", "`mimalloc`" or "`jemalloc`"). Note that mimalloc is not supported on the `x86_64-pc-windows-gnu` and `arm` targets, and you'll need to use the "standard" allocator on those platforms.

### Out-of-Memory (OOM) Prevention
Most qsv commands use a "streaming" approach to processing CSVs - "streaming" in the input record-by-record while processing it. This allows it to process arbitrarily large CSVs with constant memory.

There are a number of commands/modes however (denoted by the "exploding head" emoji - ðŸ¤¯), that require qsv to load the entire CSV into memory - `dedup` (when not using the --sorted option), `reverse`, `sort`, `stats` (when calculating the "non-streaming" extended stats), `table` and `transpose` (when not running in --multipass mode).

> NOTE: Though not as flexible, `dedup` and `sort` have corresponding "external" versions - `extdedup` and `extsort` respectively, that use external memory (i.e. disk) to process arbitrarily large CSVs.

In addition, `frequency`, `schema` and `tojsonl` - though they do not load the entire file into memory, uses additional memory proportional to the cardinality (number of unique values) of each column compared to other "streaming" commands (denoted by the "persevering face" emoji - ðŸ˜£).

For very large files, this can be a problem, as qsv will run out of memory and panic.
To prevent this, qsv has two memory check heuristics when running "non-streaming" commands:

#### NORMAL mode
1. at startup, get the TOTAL memory of the system
2. if the size of the CSV file is greater than TOTAL memory - HEADROOM (default: 20%), qsv will abort with an error

#### CONSERVATIVE mode
1. at startup, compute total available memory by adding the current available memory and free swap space 
2. subtract a percentage headroom from the total available memory (default: 20%)
3. if this adjusted total available memory is less than the size of the CSV file, qsv will abort with an error

The percentage headroom can be changed by setting the `QSV_MEMORY_HEADROOM_PCT` environment variable to a value between 10 and 90 (default: 20).

This CONSERVATIVE heuristic can have false positives however, as modern operating systems can do a fair bit of juggling to handle file sizes larger than what this heuristic will allow, as it dynamically swaps apps to the swapfile, expand the swapfile, compress memory, etc.

For example, on a 16gb Mac mini running several common apps, it only allowed ~3gb csv files, but in practice, it was able to handle files up to 8gb before this heuristic was added.

To apply this CONSERVATIVE heuristic, you can use the command's `--memcheck` option or set the `QSV_MEMORY_CHECK` environment variable.

Otherwise, the default memory check heuristic (NORMAL mode) will only check if the input file's size is larger than the TOTAL memory of the computer minus `QSV_MEMORY_HEADROOM_PCT`.  We still do this to prevent OOM panics, but it's not as restrictive as the CONSERVATIVE heuristic. (e.g. if you have a 16gb computer, the maximum input file size is 12.8gb file - 16gb minus 20% headroom).

> NOTE: These memory checks are not invoked when using stdin as input, as the size of the input file is not known. Though `schema` and `tojsonl` will still abort if stdin is too large per this memory check as it creates a temporary file from stdin before inferring the schema.

### Buffer size

Depending on your filesystem's configuration (e.g. block size, file system type, writing to remote file systems (e.g. sshfs, efs, nfs),
SSD or rotating magnetic disks, etc.), you can also fine-tune qsv's read/write buffers.

By default, the read buffer size is set to [128k](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/blob/master/src/config.rs#L16), you can change it by setting the environment
variable `QSV_RDR_BUFFER_CAPACITY` in bytes.

The same is true with the write buffer (default: 256k) with the `QSV_WTR_BUFFER_CAPACITY` environment variable.

## Multithreading

Several commands support multithreading - `count`, `stats`, `frequency`, `sample`, `schema`, `split` and `tojsonl` (when an index is available); `apply`, `applydp`, `dedup`, `diff`, `excel`, `extsort`, `joinp`, `snappy`, `sort`, `sqlp`, `to` and `validate` (no index required).

qsv will automatically spawn parallel jobs equal to the detected number of logical processors. Should you want to manually override this, use the `--jobs` command-line option or the `QSV_MAX_JOBS` environment variable.

To find out your jobs setting, call `qsv --version`.

## Version details
The `--version` option shows a lot of information about qsv. It displays:
* qsv version
* the memory allocator (`standard`, `mimalloc` or `jemalloc`)
* all enabled features (`apply`, `fetch`, `foreach`, `luau`, `polars`, `python`, `self_update` & `to`)
* Python version linked if the `python` feature was enabled
* Luau version embedded if the `luau` feature was enabled
* the number of processors to use for multi-threading commands
* the number of logical processors detected
* memory-related OOM prevention info (max "non-streaming" input file size, free swap memory, available memory & total memory)
* the target platform
* the Rust version used to compile qsv
* QSV_KIND - `prebuilt`, `prebuilt-*`, `installed` & `compiled`.
   The prebuilts are the qsv binaries published on Github with every release. `prebuilt` is built using the current Rust stable at the time of release. `prebuilt-nightly` is built using Rust nightly that passes all CI tests at the time of release.
   `installed` is qsv built using `cargo install`. `compiled` is qsv built using `cargo build`.

```bash
$ qsv --version
qsv 2.0.0-mimalloc-apply;fetch;foreach;geocode;Luau 0.653;prompt;python-3.10.14 (main, Aug  7 2024, 12:09:26) [Clang 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.23.1)];to;polars-0.45.1:py-1.19.0:72cd66a;self_update-8-8;19.20 GiB-1.59 GiB-510.91 MiB-24.00 GiB (aarch64-apple-darwin compiled with Rust 1.83) compiled
```

Shows that I'm running qsv version 2.0.0, with the `mimalloc` allocator (instead of `standard` or `jemalloc`), and I have:
- the `apply`, `fetch`, `foreach`, `geocode`, `luau`, `prompt`, `python`, `to`, `polars` and `self_update` features enabled,
- the exact version of the embedded Luau interpreter (Luau 0.653),
- Polars with its version metadata (polars-0.45.1:py-1.19.0:72cd66a),
- the Python version qsv is dynamically linked against (Python 3.10.14 (main, Aug  7 2024, 12:09:26) [Clang 16.0.0 (clang-1600.0.23.1)]). 
- qsv will use 8 logical processors out of 8 detected when running multithreaded commands.
- a maximum input file size of 19.20 GiB for "non-streaming" commands (see [Memory Management](https://github.com/dathere/qsv#memory-management) for more info), 1.59 GiB of free swap memory, 510.91 MiB of available memory and 24.00 GiB of total memory.
- the qsv binary was built to target the aarch64-apple-darwin platform (Apple Silicon), compiled using Rust 1.83.0. The binary was `compiled` using `cargo build`.

## Caching
qsv employs several caching strategies to improve performance:

* qsv has large read and write buffers to minimize disk I/O. The default read buffer size is 128k and the default write buffer size is 512k. These can be fine-tuned with the `QSV_RDR_BUFFER_CAPACITY` and `QSV_WTR_BUFFER_CAPACITY` environment variables.
* The `stats` command caches its results in both CSV and JSONL formats. It does this to avoid re-computing the same statistics when the same input file/parameters are used, but also, as statistics are used in several other commands (see [Stats Cache](#stats-cache)).   
The stats cache are automatically refreshed when the input file is modified the next time the `stats` command is run or when cache-aware commands attempt to use them. The stats cache is stored in the same directory as the input file. The stats cache files are named with the same file stem as the input file with the `stats.csv`, `stats.csv.json` and `stats.csv.data.jsonl` extensions. The CSV contains the cached stats, the JSON file contains metadata about how the stats were compiled, and the JSONL file is the JSONL version of the stats that can be directly loaded into memory by other commands. The JSONL is used by the `frequency`, `schema` and `tojsonl` commands and will only be generated when the `--stats-jsonl` option is set.
* The `geocode` command [memoizes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memoization) otherwise expensive geocoding operations and will report its cache hit rate. `geocode` memoization, however, is not persistent across sessions.
* The `fetch` and `fetchpost` commands also memoizes expensive REST API calls. When the `--redis` option is enabled, it effectively has a persistent cache as the default time-to-live (TTL) before a Redis cache entry is expired is 28 days and Redis entries are persisted across restarts. Redis cache settings can be fine-tuned with the `QSV_REDIS_CONNSTR`, `QSV_REDIS_TTL_SECONDS`, `QSV_REDIS_TTL_REFRESH` and `QSV_FP_REDIS_CONNSTR` environment variables.
* Alternatively, the `fetch` and `fetchpost` commands can use a local disk cache with the `--disk-cache` option. The default cache directory is `~/.qsv-cache/fetch`. The cache directory can be changed with the `QSV_CACHE_DIR` environment variable or the `--disk-cache-dir` command-line option. A disk cache entry is expired after 28 days by default, but this can be changed with the `QSV_DISK_CACHE_TTL_SECONDS` and `QSV_DISKCACHE_TTL_REFRESH` environment variables.
* The `luau` command caches lookup tables on disk using the QSV_CACHE_DIR environment variable and the `--cache-dir` command-line option. The default cache directory is `~/.qsv-cache`. The QSV_CACHE_DIR environment variable overrides the `--cache-dir` command-line option.

## SIMD-accelerated UTF-8 Validation for Performance
[Rust strings are utf-8 encoded](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html). As a result, qsv **REQUIRES** UTF-8 encoded files.

Still, users will attempt to use non UTF-8 encoded files, and for the most part, they will still work! This is because most qsv commands use [ByteRecords](https://docs.rs/csv/latest/csv/struct.ByteRecord.html), where qsv manipulates raw bytes and doesn't care about the encoding.

Where it does matter (indicated by the ðŸ”£ emoji), qsv will attempt to convert the bytes to UTF-8. But instead of using [std::str::from_utf8](https://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/std/str/fn.from_utf8.html), it makes extensive use of [`simdutf8`](https://github.com/rusticstuff/simdutf8#simdutf8--high-speed-utf-8-validation) for [SIMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Single_instruction,_multiple_data)-accelerated UTF-8 validation, which is up to 23x faster on x86-64 and 11x faster on aarch64 (Apple Silicon).

As UTF-8 is the de facto encoding standard, this shouldn't be a problem most of the time. However, should you need to process a CSV file with a different encoding, use the `input` command with the `--output` option first to "[loosely transcode](https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/string/struct.String.html#method.from_utf8_lossy)" it to UTF-8.

## Nightly Release Builds
Pre-built binaries compiled using Rust Nightly/Unstable are also [available for download](https://github.com/dathere/qsv/releases/latest). These binaries are optimized for size and speed:

* compiled with the last known Rust nightly/unstable that passes all ~1,800 tests.
* stdlib is compiled from source, instead of using the pre-built stdlib. This ensures stdlib is compiled with all of qsv's release settings
  (link time optimization, opt-level, codegen-units, panic=abort, etc.), presenting more opportunities for Rust/LLVM to optimize the generated code.
  This is why we only have nightly release builds for select platforms (the platform of GitHub's action runners), as we need access to the "native hardware"
  and cannot cross-compile stdlib to other platforms.
* set `panic=abort` - removing panic-handling/formatting and backtrace code, making for smaller binaries.
* enables unstable/nightly features in the `rand`, `regex`, `hashbrown`, `pyo3` and `polars` crates, that unlock performance/SIMD features on those crates.

Despite the 'unstable' label, these binaries are actually quite stable, given how [Rust is made](https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/appendix-07-nightly-rust.html) and are really more about performance (that's why we can still compile with Rust stable). You only really loose the backtrace messages when qsv panics.

If you need to maximize performance - use the nightly builds. If you prefer a "safer", rock-solid experience, use the stable builds.

If you want to really squeeze every little bit of performance from qsv, build it locally like how the Nightly Release Builds are built, with the additional step of optimizing the build to your machine's CPU by setting `RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native'`.

Doing so will ensure CPU features are tailored to your hardware and you're using the latest Rust nightly.

For example, on Ubuntu 22.04 LTS Linux:

```bash
rustup default nightly
rustup update
export RUSTFLAGS='-C target-cpu=native'

# to build qsv on nightly with all features. The binary will be in the target/release-nightly folder.
cargo build --profile release-nightly --bin qsv -Z build-std=std,panic_abort \
  -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort \
  --features all_features,nightly --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

# to build qsvlite
cargo build --profile release-nightly --bin qsvlite -Z build-std=std,panic_abort \
  -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort \
  --features lite,nightly --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu

# to build qsvdp
cargo build --profile release-nightly --bin qsvdp -Z build-std=std,panic_abort \
  -Z build-std-features=panic_immediate_abort \
  --features datapusher_plus,nightly --target x86_64-unknown-linux-gnu
```

With that said, there are times that Rust Nightly/Unstable does "break" qsv. That's why we include `qsv_rust_version_info.txt` in the 
nightly release build zip files, should you need to pin Rust to a specific nightly version when building locally.

## Benchmarking for Performance

Use and fine-tune the [benchmark script](scripts/benchmark-basic.sh) when tweaking qsv's performance to your environment.
Don't be afraid to change the benchmark data and the qsv commands to something that is more representative of your
workloads.

Use the generated benchmark TSV files to meter and compare performance across platforms. You'd be surprised how performance varies
across environments - e.g. qsv's `join` performs abysmally on Windows's WSL running Ubuntu 20.04 LTS, taking 172.44 seconds.
On the same machine, running in a VirtualBox VM at that with the same Ubuntu version, `join` was done in 1.34 seconds -
two orders of magnitude faster!

However, `stats` performs two times faster on WSL vs the VirtualBox VM - 2.80 seconds vs 5.33 seconds for the `stats_index` benchmark.
